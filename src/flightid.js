/**
 * flightid.js — a flight has a NAME and it has a KEY, and they are not the same string.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT THIS FIXES, AND WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS
 *
 * Two producers write flight legs, and they do not agree:
 *
 *   email parser →  carrier: "Japan Airlines"   flight_number: "JL 623"
 *   Duffel       →  carrier: "Japan Airlines"   flight_number: "JL623"
 *
 * And every caller that needed a FlightAware identifier built it the same way:
 *
 *   const ident = (leg.carrier || "") + (leg.flight_number || "");
 *   → "Japan AirlinesJL623"
 *
 * AeroAPI wants "JL623". It answers "Japan AirlinesJL623" with a 404, and the
 * status fetcher does `if (!r.ok) return null` — so a malformed key and a flight
 * with nothing to report produce the IDENTICAL result: null. No error. No log.
 *
 * Which means the delay monitor was DARK. Not wrong — dark. It polled, got nothing
 * back, concluded there was nothing to report, and said nothing. The entire protect
 * half of the product, the cascade, the Situation screen, the push notification that
 * is the reason this app exists — none of it could ever fire on a real flight,
 * because the key it was looking things up with was a display string with an
 * airline's full name jammed onto the front of it.
 *
 * The bug was invisible precisely BECAUSE it was total. A monitor that never fires
 * looks exactly like a world where nothing has gone wrong.
 *
 * So: two functions, two purposes, and a hard refusal in the middle.
 *
 *   displayName(leg) → "Japan Airlines JL 623"   for a person to read
 *   apiKey(leg)      → "JL623"                   for a machine to look up
 *   apiKey returns NULL when it cannot build a real one — and callers must not
 *   fetch with null. An absent key is not a key that happens to be wrong.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
